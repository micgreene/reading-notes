 ## What is a Linked List?
   **A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link. There are two types of Linked List - Singly and Doubly.**<br />
  
   ### Terminology <br />
   + *Linked List* A data structure that contains nodes that links/points to the next node in the list.
   + *Singly* - Singly refers to the number of references the node has. A Singly linked list means that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list.
   + *Doubly* - Doubly refers to there being two (double) references within the node. A Doubly linked list means that there is a reference to both the Next and Previous node.
   + *Node* - Nodes are the individual items/links that live in a linked list. Each node contains the data for each link.
   + *Next* - Each node contains a property called Next. This property contains the reference to the next node.
   + *Head* - The Head is a reference of type Node to the first node in a linked list.
   + *Current* - The Current is a reference of type Node to the node that is currently being looked at. When traversing, you create a new Current variable at the Head to guarantee you are starting from the beginning of the linked list.
