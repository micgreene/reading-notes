**Growth mindset centers around believing one is capable of changing themselves in the way that they envision. A growth minded person always looks to defeat the version of themselves from yesterday in some way.**

### Important points to maintain a growth mindset mentality:
1. **Do not** fear failure. To be defeated is only an opportunity to understand your current weaknesses.
1. Share what you make, and encourage others also brave enough to share. The fear of embarassment is synonymous with the fear of failure.
1. Get _excited_ for new challenges! The hardest thing you've accomplished has now made everything easier _forever_.


# Emotional Intelligence
  + Psychologist Daniel Goleman identified five elements that make up emotional intelligence. These are:
    1. **Self-awareness**
    2. **Self-regulation**
    3. **Motivation**
    4. **Empathy**
    5. **Social skills**

## **Assess your emotional intelligence.**
  + I believe I have a fairly good level of self-awareness, I generally understand my feelings and where they derive from and I notice when my ability to communicate in a postive manner has become compromised.
  + I belive my greatness weakness when it comes to self-regulation is the fact I have can procrastinate at times. I usually have to make sure I keep my work to a good timetable to account for this.
  + My motivation suffers as much as the next persons does from time to time, I try to use small rewwads to motivate my efforts when I'm low on energy.
  + I think I possess a healthy level of empathy, I usually try to understand my peers and what ciru=cumstances might be coloring their mood.
  + My social skills are fairly well developed, although I can be impatient with people I fell as though are moving "too slow" for my tastes.

# Personal Biases
  + There are many types of biases:
    + Gender bias - the favoring of one gender over another
    + Ageism - the favoring of one age group over another
    + Name bias - the favoring of one type of name over another in terms of cultural markers
    + Beauty bias - the favoring of one body type or certain looks over others
    + Halo effect - a type of cognitive bias in which our overall impression of a person influences how we feel and think about their character. Essentially, your overall impression of a person ("He is nice!") impacts your evaluations of that person's specific traits ("He is also smart!").
    + Confirmation bias - the tendency to interpret new evidence as confirmation of one's existing beliefs or theories.
    + Conformity bias - is when our deep-seated need to belong causes us to adapt our behaviours to feel like part of the group. Rather than using personal and ethical judgment, people imitate the behaviour of others in a bid to toe the party line.

## Assess your biases.
  + I know for a fact that I have an ageist bias, I often notice I have a hard time communicating with older employers and co-workers as their experiences don't feel relevant to mine.
  + I also tend to be very engaging with people, so those who don't speak up or who are social anxious I often may overlook their concerns as I didn't think to stop and check in with them at times.
