# **Reading Assignment 1 - Intro to Big O and Python**

 ## Big O notation- Notation which marks the amount and time and memory an algorithm takes to complete.
  + *O(1)* - algorithm that correlates 1 to 1 with the input data, as data grows Big O grows linearly.
  + *O(N)* - algorithm that uses some kind of variable amounts of data, this could mean an array or list must be iterated over.
  + *O(N^2)* -  represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set. This is common with algorithms that involve nested iterations over the data set.
  + *O(2^N)* - an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set.
  + *O(logN)* - means that the time grows linearly while the input size n is growing exponentially.

 ## Python
 
   + **Python** - simplistic mechanics in which the effects can be surprising**
   + **Names** - refer to values
   +  **Values** - live until no more references -Immutable values can't be changed in place.
   +  **Assignment** - never copies data
   +  **Changes** - are visible through all names
   +  **Mutable aliasing** - happens when there is mutable value
   +  **Mutable and immutable** - exactly the same for all values. Changing is what is altered and can result in different effects.
   +  **Names** have no type and values have no scope
