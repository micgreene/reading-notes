# **Reading Assignment 8 - Access Control (ACL)**

## When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization?
 + ref: https://community.mega.com/t5/REST-API/Basic-Auth-vs-Bearer-Token/td-p/23476
  + *Basic Auth* utilizes a username:password combo that is typically encoded using base64 to be sent for request. This is useful for when we need to only make a single call and receive a single response, such as log-ins and searching data from the DB.
  + *Bearer Auth* utilizes a 'bearer token' to allow access to routes that require it to be connected to. This involves 2 calls:
    1.  a call to receive the token amd
    2.  a call to get the data
    + Bearer tokens are handy because they can be revoked after a set amount of time, allowing the user to only have to make the token call once during a session, then expiring for security purposes later.
 
## What does the JSON Web Token package do?
  + ref: https://jwt.io/introduction#:~:text=JSON%20Web%20Token%20(JWT)%20is,because%20it%20is%20digitally%20signed.
    + **JSON Web Token (JWT)** is an open standard that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. This means, without the proper signature, the information could not be decoded without the knowing the proper signature first.

## What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?
  + ref: https://blog.gitguardian.com/secrets-api-management/
    1. Never store unencrypted secrets in .git repositories. Avoid git add * commands on git. Add sensitive files in .gitignore. Don't rely on code reviews to discover secrets.
    2. Don't share your secrets unencrypted in messaging systems like slack.
    3. Store secrets safely.
    4. Restrict API access and permissions.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

    + the process of converting information or data into a code, especially to prevent unauthorized access.
  + **token**

      +  the thing that applications use to make API requests on behalf of a user. The access token represents the authorization of a specific application to access specific parts of a user’s data.
  + **bearer**
    + ref: https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication
    + also called token authentication) is an HTTP authentication scheme that involves security tokens called bearer tokens. 
    + The name “Bearer authentication” can be understood as “give access to the bearer of this token.” 
    + The bearer token is a cryptic string, usually generated by the server in response to a login request. 
    + The client must send this token in the Authorization header when making requests to protected resources.
