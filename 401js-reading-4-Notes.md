# **Reading Assignment 4 - Data Modeling**

  ## Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
  + Ref: https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/tdd/
    + There is a significant reduction in bgs and defects.
    + The amount of time saved in the final stages of development.
    + The internal quality of the code is overall improved as well as the design quality.

  ## In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
   + **Supertest**
      + https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest
   + **Nock**
      + https://github.com/nock/nock
   + **Mockserver**
      + https://www.npmjs.com/package/mockserver

  ## What is one downside of Test Driven Development
  + Ref: https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/tdd/
   + Initial development time is increased as a result.

  ## Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
  + Ref: https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-s-the-difference-between-class-prototypal-inheritance-e4cd0a7562e9
    + Classes are like blueprints, basically models for an object to eventually be created from. Prototypes are working object instances already created that inherit from other objects.

  ## Why REST?
  + Ref: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/671118/what-exactly-is-restful-programming#:~:text=REST%20stands%20for%20Representational%20State,sometimes%20spelled%20%22ReST%22.)&text=RESTful%20applications%20use%20HTTP%20requests,%2FUpdate%2FDelete)%20operations.
    + **ReST (Representational State Transfer)** is used because all four CRUD actions can be performed using simple HTTP calls. The internet itself uses a ReST based architecture.

  ## Document the following Vocabulary Terms
   + **functional programming**
   + Ref: https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-functional-programming-7f218c68b3a0
    +  the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects.
    
   + **object-oriented programming (OOP)**
   + Ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming
    +  a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).
    
   + **class**
   + Ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)
    +  an extensible program-code-template for creating objects, providing initial values for state (member variables) and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).
    
   + **super**
   + Ref: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/super
    +  The super keyword is used to access and call functions on an object's parent.
    
   + **this**
   + Ref: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this
    + when referencing an object, 'this' is a reference to all properties of the object itself
    
   + **Test Driven Development (TDD)**
   + Ref: + Ref: https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/tdd/
    +  the process of building software by creating test cases to be passed instead of code to be tested. used to reduce the amount of bugs and defect in code during development.
    
   + **Jest**
   + Ref: https://jestjs.io/
    +  a JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.
    
   + **Continuous Integration (CI)**
   + Ref: https://www.ericsson.com/en/ci-cd?gclid=Cj0KCQiA4feBBhC9ARIsABp_nbWqhWNKvaYFtai_LjqvQAk1nQ9V6onePkQbgXHAKBb3dgt4IG8BkVEaAtWYEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds
    +  the continuous provision of all the elements needed to deliver a new release achieved by an automated process of secure and frequent integration of source code into source baselines and binaries into system binaries. essentially, constantly updating a product throughout its lifecycle.
    
   + **REST**
   + Ref: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/671118/what-exactly-is-restful-programming
    +  (Representational State Transfer) uses HTTP to create requests. used for simplicity and flexibility.
    
   + **Data Model**
   + Ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_modeling
    +  a process used to define and analyze data requirements needed when building the logic for your code.
