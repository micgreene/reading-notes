 ## What Is a File?
  + *Files on most modern file systems are composed of three main parts:*
    + Header: metadata about the contents of the file (file name, size, type, and so on)
    + Data: contents of the file as written by the creator or editor
    + End of file (EOF): special character that indicates the end of the file

 ## File Paths
   + *When you access a file on an operating system, a file path is required. The file path is a string that represents the location of a file. Itâ€™s broken up into three major parts:*
    + Folder Path: the file folder location on the file system where subsequent folders are separated by a forward slash / (Unix) or backslash \ (Windows)
    + File Name: the actual name of the file
    + Extension: the end of the file path pre-pended with a period (.) used to indicate the file type
    
 ## Opening and Closing a File in Python
  + `file = open('dog_breeds.txt')`
  + `with open('dog_breeds.txt', 'r') as reader`
  + 'r'	Open for reading (default)
  + 'w'	Open for writing, truncating (overwriting) the file first
  + 'rb' or 'wb'	Open in binary mode (read/write using byte data)
