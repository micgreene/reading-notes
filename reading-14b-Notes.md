# **Reading Assignment 14B - What Google Learned About Teams**

## Project Aristotle
  + In 2012, the company embarked on an initiative — code-named Project Aristotle — to study hundreds of Google’s teams and figure out why some stumbled while others soared.
    + How often did teammates socialize outside the office? Did they have the same hobbies? Were their educational backgrounds similar? Was it better for all teammates to be outgoing or for all of them to be shy?
      +  "We looked at 180 teams from all over the company," Abeer Dubey, a manager in Google’s People Analytics division, said. "We had lots of data, but there was nothing showing that a mix of specific personality types or skills or backgrounds made any difference. The ‘who’ part of the equation didn’t seem to matter."
      
  + ### Group Norms
    + Norms are the traditions, behavioral standards and unwritten rules that govern how we function when we gather: 
      + One team may come to a consensus that avoiding disagreement is more valuable than debate, another team might develop a culture that encourages vigorous arguments and spurns groupthink
      + Team members may behave in certain ways as individuals — they may chafe against authority or prefer working independently — but when they gather, the group’s norms typically override individual proclivities and encourage deference to the team.
      + After looking at over a hundred groups for more than a year, Project Aristotle researchers concluded that understanding and influencing group norms were the keys to improving Google’s teams. But they needed to figure out which norms mattered most.
 
 + ### Psychological Safety
    + Within psychology, researchers sometimes colloquially refer to traits like 'conversational turn-taking' and 'average social sensitivity' as aspects of what’s known as **psychological safety**.  
      + A shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking 
    
    + When Rozovsky and her Google colleagues encountered the concept of psychological safety in academic papers, it was as if everything suddenly fell into place. Most of all, employees had talked about how various teams felt. 
      + For Project Aristotle, research on psychological safety pointed to particular norms that are vital to success. 
    
    + In late 2014, Project Aristotle began sharing their findings with select groups of Google’s 51,000 employees. By then, they had been collecting surveys, conducting interviews and analyzing statistics for almost three years.
      + In the best teams, members listen to one another and show sensitivity to feelings and needs.

Project Aristotle is a reminder that when companies try to optimize everything, it’s sometimes easy to forget that success is often built on experiences — like emotional interactions and complicated conversations and discussions of who we want to be and how our teammates make us feel.
