# **Reading Assignment 14b - Project Ideas & APIs**

1. ### What ideas do you have for projects? 
  + An app converting entered amounts of money into foreign currency.
  + An app that checks for prices for video games and highlights sales, perhaps.
  + An app that checks the rankings for a certain game or sport and perhaps upcoming events or competitions.
  
2. ### What would your model be that you can control and update the view with?
  + The model would be that of a server that take in some kind of user input in the front end then converts it into an API call to retrieve information. This info would be stored in a database and taken from the database instead of the API call if it has been referenced before. A page should render a personal collection of saved searches or perhaps favorite players, fighters, preferred currency, favorite genres, etc.
  
3. ### What API(s) could you use to make this a reality?
    + 1Forge looks perfect for coverting currency amounts
    + CheapShark checks for videogame prices and sales on Steam, IGDB is a videogame database for information.
    + There are several APIs that give sports info like NHL Records and Stats and NBA Stats. We could use a combination of APIs and use radio buttons to sleect preferred sports for info, perhaps.
