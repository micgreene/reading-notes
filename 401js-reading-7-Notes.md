Write the following steps in the correct order:
Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret
Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party
Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint
Receive authorization code
Make a request to the access token endpoint
Receive access token
Make a request to a third-party API endpoint
What can you do with an authorization code?
This gives you sign-in privileges when you attempt to log in.

What can you do with an access token?
This gives the signed in user a 'pass' to continue to any route in the app that requires it.

Whatâ€™s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?
It is a much more complete version of crypto, offering better data security.
