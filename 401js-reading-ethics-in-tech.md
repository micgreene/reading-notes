1. ## "The Code I'm Still Ashamed Of" by Bill Sourour

    + Often in the pursuit of advancement in our careers we are pressured into betraying values that we would never think of on our own time. This article described a developer who created a website for a pharmaceutical corporation which featured a quiz that was rigged into recommending a particular prescribed drug regardless of your responses, as per the request of the client. This drug carried a side effect of extreme hormone imbalances which lead to severe depression in some, and ultimately a teen girl whom the drug was marketed towards took her own life as a result of its use. This hits me personally close to home because of my prior military service. During deployment in Iraq, one of the things that bothered me most was 'cordon and search' missions in which we would search (really, raid) residences to drive combatants to a corner where they could be engaged. Entering homes and turning corners of alleys, you mainly see mothers clutching their children in fear or men who would borderline faint as they imagined the burst from my rifle, and all the while we were constantly assured our mission was just. In the end you realize there is no honor, only pain. I think as a result of that history, I would be hard pressed to keep my mouth shut if I had similar concerns. I am happy I read this, as it will keep me much more wary of what I work on in the future.

2. ## "BIG DATA IS OUR GENERATION’S CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE, AND WE DON’T KNOW IT" by Alistair
  + ### ref: http://solveforinteresting.com/big-data-is-our-generations-civil-rights-issue-and-we-dont-know-it/
    + The article posited the idea that the information technology industry will eventually attempt to violate or undermine civil rights through their collection of our personal info. I thought a good example was of the practice of "redlining" by banks, where certain types of loans would be restricted to people living in certain regions of a city due to race or culture. Many social media platforms, Facebook probably being the worst offender, are able to correlate all the data that is processed through your profile and then make accurate predictions based on what is collected. For example, the article refers to OKcupid’s 2010 blog post “The Real Stuff White People Like” in which the authors picked out key words and phrases exchanged under certain profiles to predict what race/sex/religion a particular user was with no other input. Unfortunately while technological progress seems never ending, so too does human bigotry, and large companies being able to essentially "profile" their customer base means that such practices like the aforementioned "redlining" could easily resume. The problem has already begun in the financial sector as credit card companies now try to alter credit limits of their customers due to them shopping in stores that other customers "have a poor repayment history with.” I thought the idea of attaching certain information with some kind of encryption that dictates usage rights was fairly ingenious, if not entirely possible with our current physical restrictions in data exchange.
